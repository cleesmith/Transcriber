Okay, I'm live. Hello everyone. How are you all doing?

Can you all hear me? Let's start with that. I've pinned today's Notion
document in the live stream, live feed, and it's also already in the
description for the video.

And you'll notice it's a novel crafter link, but that'll just take you
straight to the Notion document. We're just trying to tidy things up.
So don't worry about that.

We got you all good. But yeah, hello. So this is a slightly later
timed stream and it's going to just be for the hour so we're going to
try and cram more in but see how it goes and then maybe also be doing
a stream later in the week kind of more appropriate for um those of
you who are in like American time zones so it's gonna be a late night
for me but um we're gonna do that um hopefully with a guest so keep
your your ears eyes peeled everything peeled potatoes um for the
announcement about that stream um but yes um morning afternoon evening
everyone um and yeah let's get started so this is kind of the we we've
spent a lot of time kind of preparing our novel um and going through
all the different kind of um like kind of almost like pre-
developmental edits like doing them before we've written the book
using our novel kind of outline as context.

But now we're gonna just dive in and start writing. And so this next
batch of episodes in the series are going to go into kind of like how
to use Novel Crafter to kind of, once you've got your plan to start
writing. And then we're gonna look a little bit at the text
replacement prompts in later sessions and kind of just start plugging
through.

But this session is on the first chapter beats. It's on how to kind of
get those formatted and we've got some new prompts to share with y'all
in the document. And also kind of the value of beginning to write
yourself before going with the AI so like I will show you this because
I was doing some testing like you know to make sure that this would
work and it's crazy like it's really nice to see kind of the
vindication of actually what your input and how it influences the AI.

So yeah. Okay. So I've included on here some kind of helpful links.

So there's the past, I think the first one is from the Red Riding Hood
beats class. And that spoke about, we tested different styles of beats
that you've seen in the short form video um and then there's the um
I'm guessing the next one will be um the document for um the the the
oh my goodness words words. Um, Cozy Mystery.

Completely forgot what I did then. Yeah, so the Cozy Mystery. Um, and
so you can look back at past lessons if you don't want to have to
check out four hours worth of live streams.

There's also a, um, document. The third document is the kind of script
I used for one of the short form beats videos, if you prefer to read.
And then we've, um, included a link to kind of any short form beats
videos if you prefer to read and then we've included a link to kind of
any novel crafter videos we've already done on beats okay um so that
that's our kind of catch-up um and yeah I'll just get started in.

Seems like there's a good amount of you here. So yeah, let's begin.
Okay.

First of all, I think is a thing that a lot of writers, like I know I
had issues with this when I first started writing with AI because it
wasn't how I thought when I wrote. But like, what is a beat? And
essentially a beat is a short set of instructions that kind of detail
what happens in like a single moment of a story.

So it's like kind of like a summary but depending on the type of beat
it can encompass other stuff. But think of it as like a summary, like
a very like micro detailed like you this is the telling not showing of
uh writing the beat like you're just telling what happens and then you
pop it into prose later on so we're gonna have a brief interlude
reverse engineering beats so I like to think about like my writing and
well kind of when I was making the fine tunes I noticed like we
noticed in general that there was um a difference in the quality of
output depending on whether we wrote our own beats or if we got the AI
to summarize the prose to make a beat um I think that's because often
we summarize things a lot more concisely because we have a filter of
what we believe is important. So I've included this kind of 400-ish
word chunk of prose that I've written as like the first beat for this
story and then in the next paragraph or the next like drop down, I've
included how I would summarize it if I was to like summarize it as a
beat.

And then we have here. So I use the general purpose prompt. I kind of
basically gave the AI, you know, told it what a beat was.

Please write a single story beat for the following prose. the
following pros and then we can see here the different outputs from
various models. There is a little bit crossed out in Sonnet because it
got a detail wrong but I thought I wanted to include it so that you
could see kind of where it had not quite summarized but all of them
have done a good job they're just a lot longer so it's kind of it's a
lot more telly and so I kind of see that as a most like a guide for so
if this is what it took the text for to then put as a summary it might
be that to get prose nearer to what you want, you have to be a little
bit more descriptive in your beats.

But that's for more of your, if you want more control over your
writing. If you kind of are more a pantser and you just want to see
how things go, go ahead. Just put a short thing in and you'll find it
really inspires your creativity.

Okay. and like you'll you'll find it it really inspires your
creativity okay um so yeah you can you can check all this out here um
but how do we work out what our next beat is so kind of like how do we
like take um the overall flow of beats and kind of get it to work
because a lot of times like if you just ask GPT or Claude or whatever
to just be like that you kind of like it'll come out kind of weird
like it'll they will give you beats but it won't be they won't be
meaty enough to kind of show of show everything that you personally
would want to encompass in a chapter. So I kind of like, when I make
my beats I tend to have an idea of how I want a scene to play out
because I'm quite a heavy plotter and so, however, I'll tweak as I go.

But Corey this week has been doing some amazing work making us a new
prompt so I'm really excited to kind of like debut it here and there's
so if you want to copy it you can copy from here go on to prompts then
click new and create from clipboard. And that string of letters is
basically like a shorthand way of doing the prompt with all the
models. So you'll keep all the models that he has selected and all the
text in there.

So everything is like duplicated. So it's a brilliant way of sharing
your prompts with other people. everything is like duplicated.

So it's a brilliant way of sharing your prompts with other people.
Okay, oh, Jean-Luc says that Sonnet's been behaving strangely on
occasion. Yeah, I've seen that like a few times like with different
prompts.

It's not been wowing me as much as it has in the past, which kind of
makes me wonder, have we got a Claude 2.1 scenario? Hopefully not, but
we'll see. So yeah, so Corey has now written a nice little bit for us
which goes hand-in-hand with the prompt.

So if you've... I don't know if you you've heard of the the scene
sequel method. let me so yeah so the scene sequel are two types of
written passages used by authors to advance the plot in a story so
scenes propel it forward and sequels are kind of like a reaction um I
like to I like that and I kind of like it always reminds me of that
when I read this progression that Corey has kind of has um developed
for us um hey Joe uh so we have a character has a goal, the goal leads
to a conflict, the conflict leads to an outcome, either good or bad,
then there is a reaction to that, the reaction leads to a dilemma and
then that dilemma leads to a decision which then leads to a further
goal and then it keeps going.

So this could be split over multiple chapters, especially if like, I
don't know if it's like, you could have like as a longer form or if it
was a fight scene, you might have multiple of these within a chapter.
And that's kind of like up to you for, it's up to you to kind of
determine what pacing you want. However, using this is really good for
getting a good start with AI.

We've also trying to kind of fix the tie up. We've included a little
bit extra in the prompt that gives kind of like a prompt for the AI to
kind of add a little bit of a cliffy, a cliffhanger on the end of the
chapter so if we go into uh version five so you're a helpful expert
plot outline assistant um whenever you're given a scene or chapter
summary develop a list of detailed scene beats, don't be vague, write
out specific ideas. So we've got this that we were just talking about,
we then have the random cliffhanger, so the AI will choose the random
cliffhanger which kind of also adds a bit of surprise for you but you
can also use this you could then ask as a follow-up question give me
five more cliffhangers that I could use.

You don't have to go with what the AI is saying it's just kind of
adding a way to try and tie up the scene without it doing boitis. So
yes let's see how this goes. So I've been playing around with this a
little bit.

So here we have, I've included the large kind of chapter summary that
we were working on. This can all be found so we've got chapter summary
and the detailed summary and then I also tried some abbreviated
summaries with this and then we have some work so we've got different
versions you can kind of read through these a little bit like in your
own time it'll be quicker I think than me reading them out however you
can kind of read through these a little bit like in your own time
it'll be quicker I think than me reading them out however you can see
that in the detailed summary there is much more so like Perrin so in
the chapter summary there's a large amount on the fixing and the
sabotage and then afterwards at the very end Perrin comes along with
his sniffer dog, however in the abbreviated summary a lot of that is
kind of skimmed over. And so the proportion of which Perrin and the
sniffer dog are actually there becomes much more prominent.

And so that reflects in the beats that are generated. So it's kind of
worth keeping that in mind. Like when you give a chapter summary for
beats to be made, pace it in the way that you would pace the chapter.

Like if something's only gonna happen at the end, don't mention it
loads because otherwise, because the AI doesn't know that's what
you're thinking. Oh yeah. And I kind of like how, depending on how
much different detail you put in, there very much is a different
emphasis that the AI thinks of the conflicts so here in this one with
the the detailed summary it takes the conflict as the uh Delilah's
impatience during the broadcast whereas in the shorter summary where
it's kind of very quickly glossed over, the conflict is finding the
earring and a clue to the saboteur.

So now I would probably do something that's in between, like I
probably wouldn't pick either myself. However, it's interesting to see
kind of that you have all these different iterations and you can just
click retry or please go again or just start another conversation and
it will give you a lot of options. So what I'm gonna do now is I've
started working on kit bashing, I think I, because I was testing out
the prompts, I had about 10 different versions of this so I've started
work on kit bashing these as I'm gonna go I've been doing it in the
right interface and then I've got a snippet as well with some of the
bits that I need to put in so I'm going to work on that for a little
bit and then we're gonna go on to actually using the beats and doing
two sample chapters so one will use um my pros at the beginning and
one will use AI generated pros at the beginning and then I think we're
going to do like a compare and contrast so if there's definitely some
like insatiable curiosity that in all these summaries has very much
become like a um aism um Delilah quickly recognises the cut wires and
the deliberate nature of the sabotage.

I'm going to say and concludes sabotage. Mainly because, like of
course it's sabotage um mainly because like of course it's sabotage um
by curiosity she opens sabotage the uh not the wires um i guess the
power in the and then I've added a location for this. I had an acronym
and I cannot remember what it is.

Infrastructure hubs. And PDAC stands for power distribution and
control center and so that's kind of like the the main where how to
divert the power to different areas of the city I'm sorry driven by
curiosity finding the source of the smell. It opens up the panel.

I'm going to say creating a lull as the clanking of daily life stops.
Delilah however uses the opportunity to search for a snack in her
pocket, irritated at the enforced downtime and before she can take a
bite the lights flicker back on restoring yeah sorry from a distance
calls out to Lila you I back to test good hand and she reluctantly
gets back look Who's quote? you like some of these beats because
they're AI generated they are a little bit more worthy than I'd like
so I'll probably cut them down a little bit more but I'm kind of
curious to see how it goes as well I mean I mean yeah although I
suppose that would be a good chance to and how they impact on this
city city.

Well, it was efficiently and you back to these she's thinking about
the sub touch okay um Picking away her tools into her belt, Delilah
realizes that the bolt wasn't a... that fell wasn't a bolt, it was
during pockets a bolt falls and okay Okay. Or she and or she can look
at the earring.

the earring the cable securing Delilah around always pulls her back
towards the entrance It goes to take a closer look at the earring that
she can see. But before she can inspect it, pockets. um pockets um
Then um Hmm emerging from the tunnel killer encounter Thank you.

you here's him talking and lines that the man's name is Perrin. I'm
going to go ahead and do that. Uneasily if then I'm making up an Eve
And and lets her go with a wave of his the earring again and
recognizes the engraving on the gold on the silver metal it belongs to
her sister and then that like is the like the conclusion of the first
chapter I think okay so then I want to make sure that I kitbash this
little bit in you you you you you you you you you Okay, I think I'm
fairly happy with that.

Let me, so I pressed control A twice, because if you do control A
once, it'll just go over a paragraph. Whereas if you do it twice, it
will do the entire chapter. So I will put this here for you um my plan
i'm actually just gonna pop that in here um because i'm not gonna so
usually so a lot of the times you could have like your scene beats
here um in your your scene summary however it's not going to access
that so i like to um i will end up putting them here however we're
going to do an experiment so we've got our two things uh so we're
gonna have my bad can i rename subtitle um this is the one with kate
prose um to start and then this is the one uh i guess okay prose and
what i will do as well is to ensure that the previous chapter doesn't
influence this chapter I will switch their order as we go along but
I'm just gonna so to do the shortcut I'm doing uh shift and then the
little line slash backward dash and then press space and it comes up
i'm just creating these lines as well because if you don't um the
beats end up being next to each other and i don't aesthetically like
that for my mind um i prefer there to be a space okay so all this
first for the the Kate prose this first scene beat hasn't quite
finished as you can see like we end up with her finding the sabotage
but this bit hasn't happened yet so I'm going to put that this bit at
the top and then I will add a new scene beat to include that and some
of the next and this next bit but before we continue I will also show
you the so the I use I'm I've got my my current, you can copy here.

It's a slightly adapted version of the one from Space, which I've
included on here. And there is the prose style guide, which I've put
as Delilah's scenes are succinct, filled with attitude and casual
comments on what she sees. While she uses proper grammar, scenes from
her perspective are conversational and her running commentary is
forever on the move um my prompt as well current writing prompt um
includes the genre and the theme and then also um some little bits on
like avoiding certain stuff so we'll see how well that works.

Before I begin, does anyone have any questions? Where are my A.I.isms
list. Rose Style Guide.

My theme. These are both global entries. And I think I will start with
the Kate prose version.

See how it goes. I also did some character prep. some different bits
about the buildings and the characters if you wanted to reference them
um I was going to use sonnet but if that's been playing up recently...

Still go Sonnet. We'll see how Sonnet does. I like Sonnet.

I mean I like Opus better but money. Let's go, current writing prompt.
We can try Sonnet and then also try Opus maybe and not Opus, 4.0, see
how that goes for mimicking style.

So things I'm looking for here are how well it continues on from the
previous beat, kind of what I feel the, how I feel the voice is, and
if it's, yeah, followed the beat itself. I'm gonna click apply. Okay,
if it's acting up more in chat than prose, that's fine.

Brilliant. So we've got before she can delve deeper, the overhead
lights flicker off, signalling the start of the daily Archon's
broadcast. Delilah grumbles about the inconvenience, annoyed at the
interruption.

The broadcast compels all the workers to cease their activities and
listen intently, creating a lull as the yadda yadda, she looks for a
snack, the lights flicker back on. Okay so I will... let's see, so the
site before Delilah didn't fill her with much hope.

The base of the panel was a molten mess, smoking wires poking out
plastic gunk. She sniffed cautiously. Whilst lack of ventilation hit
the exact time of sabotage, the damage didn't feel old.

She felt the edges of the casing, finding the plastic supple to the
touch and still warm. The overhead lights flickered, plunging Delilah
into darkness. She froze, hands still resting on the melted panel as
the familiar droning voice of the Archon crackled through unseen
speakers.

Blessed are those who walk the path of righteousness. I feel like
that's probably Archon, um, the title filling in that so delilah
rolled her eyes as if that pretentious windbag knew anything about
being righteous she fumbled in her pocket fingers closing around stale
protein bar um as the arkans platitudes washed over her ripping it
open with her teeth she She took a bite, the dry crumbs sticking in
her throat. For a few blessed moments, the only sounds were the
Archon's muffled ramblings and her own chewing.

No clanging machinery, no shouts from overseas, just blissful quiet.
Then the lights blinked back on, harsh and unforgiving. Delilah!

Zora's shrill voice shattered the calm. Have you found anything yet?
Delilah swallowed hard, the protein bar turning to sawdust in her
mouth, back to the grind.

She peered closer at the ruined circuitry, prodding gingerly at the
still-worn plastic. Fresh damage, no question, but who would sabotage
the power grid and why? A dozen potential culprits sprang to mind,
rebels and disgruntled workers and even bored kids looking for kicks,
but none of the usual suspects fit.

This was too precise, too surgical. No wanton destruction, just a
strategic strike to cripple the system. Nicodemus's words from a few
nights ago echoed in her mind.

There are bigger players in this game than you realise, girl. People
with plans that stretch back decades, maybe centuries. At the time she
dismissed it as the ravings of a paranoid old man, but now?

Delilah's gaze drifted up to the scorched panel, taking in the melted
components and frayed wiring. This wasn't some random act of
vandalism. This was a calculated move in a much larger game.

Her fingers tightened around the power cable as a shiver ran down her
spine. Take a drink. Whatever was happening here, she was a mere pawn.

One of the real players wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice. Delilah,
Zora's voice cut through her thoughts, much more insistent now. What's
the prognosis?

Delilah took a breath, shoving aside her unease, as she always did,
one problem at a time. It's going to take some work, she called back,
already reaching for her tools, but I'll have it sorted. For now, at
least.

But as she set to work repairing the latest damage, she couldn't...
Okay, so this last paragraph um just get rid of like that's all 99% of
the time with AI like the issue with AI wrapping things up is it's
kind of trained in a question answer format so imagine if you were
asking for a recipe and the recipe cut out mid like your cake being in
the oven and you didn't know how long you had to leave it in for. That
wouldn't be great and so it's kind of like I feel like every time
we're asking it to cut off early it's kind of trying to go against its
will.

However if you a um let's let me just try this again with my um this
is with fine-tune prompt i've done where i've fine-tuned the model to
answer not completely so i think this will will kind of just show how
different it is. Yeah, so you can see here it's finished mid kind of
broadcast as it were. I will put this into the document for you all
and then we're going to do the where the AI has done both beats and
we'll kind of do a compare contrast that goes okay so then what I will
do to ensure that it doesn't mess anything up I'm sticking this at the
front so that means there's no way that it's reading because it's not
reading back so go back into the ordinary world up here um so then we
go current writing pros on it you okay so I'm gonna put the pros here
and so you can kind of compare the two versions.

I kind of like to know, like not gonna be offended at all, is there
a... Do you have a preference at all? Like, you know, it'd be
interesting to know.

I kind of feel like my prose style has helped with this um i'm just
gonna let's just see how different the pros is without the style guide
you okay interesting I'm certain that we put the pro style guide back
so I mean obviously this paragraph is just a thing the style guide has
definitely made a difference I think whatever causes reek it couldn't
good I do like how Sonnet brings up different facts from the past.
Yeah, I don't like Dijon Luke. I don't like that it doesn't have any
especially because it does I think it doesn't mention it in that yeah
Okay so I'm just going to get rid of the last paragraph again and I'm
going to generate the next section.

section Of course it's kind of then started repeating things Okay, it
has got some dialogue that's nice now I feel like... There's some
interesting dialogue. But...

It's kind of missing something. You know, when you kind of like...
Like, also, she's in a tunnel.

She ain't seeing any faces. So... There's...

Yeah. I mean, I don't know what you guys think, um... But I...

I prefer the prose that came out here and then I do for this second
one what do you guys think? So I think in the same vein, I might so
I'm going to archive this original scene and then go to this new one
back to my original and I'm going to edit this and then continue going
through. So we've got 15 minutes so I'm gonna see what I can get done
in 15 minutes.

Do any of you have any questions about the stuff that we've done so
far today? Because I can answer them as I'm as I'm doing this if you
want me to. So this prompt technically asks for a good ratio of like
at least 30% dialogue.

So it's not exactly like it should, you know. It shouldn't be doing
this. oh yeah of course this was the the i was so confused then for a
moment.

That's the Kate Fine tune one. So to a blink of an eye, who asks, do
you use rephrase prompts at this stage to improve the output and or
add dialogue? So currently I do a mix um my favorite um rephrase
prompt would be a um my fine-tuned one however that's going to be next
week's topic so we're going to go through that more next week but we
are going to cover that um I kind of like...

I use a mix. I kind of sometimes forget about using prompts for the
the rephrasing. So, I'm going to go ahead and do that.

until the Oh so for Nakua to create the box for kitbashing if you go
onto your like side panel snippet you can open up a snippet and then
press this pin icon at the top and then that pins it to the side and
then I tend to minimize the sidebar. I just should have untangled the
wires. plastic bird punny I feel like that's good because it kind of
introduces the town or the like the city as well.

Bless her those who walk by. As if that pretentious windbag knew
anything about being righteous. She fumbled in her pockets, fingers
closing around a stale protein bar as the archon's platitudes um
washed over ripping it over with a tea you okay so some bits i'm going
to have to you so some bits I'm gonna have to remove like obviously
Thank you.

you who wants Okay so then that's again implying starting to imply the
cold and it wasn't it wasn't precise or surgical I would get rid of
some of this which is fine Thank you. So pretty as you Thank you. you
it's interesting how um you it's interesting how or into the packaging
with a teeth up in both like ripping it from the teeth like it seems
to have an idea of what it wants Thank you.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um...

you ah okay that will do okay let's let's do one more time and get the
next I should have included a before and after I what do I have
amazing pros before pros after edits then if you want to you can see
like what I've edited well like what I've edited um cool um All right.
Writing. current writing yeah and a final call for questions if anyone
has them um if not i will do this little bit and then we can head off
but next week um i'm definitely going to be doing some some work on
like um kind of taking a chapter that we've generated and using um
different prompts so like if anyone has any prompts that they want to
share in the discord community that would also be really cool and i
can try some of them out kind of just showcase what we have with um
with editing and kind of adding in say if we wanted to do like a micro
beat in the middle of there to add in a bit extra we could do that
Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Okay.

Thank you. I think, I'm not meant to know, it's Kiris. Thank you.

you and I'll work that out later okay it's um five o'clock now so I
will head off but thank you all for coming I hope you enjoyed it um I
look forward to the stream that might be happening later this week And
of course for Saturday's stream where we will go over. I think what I
will do is finish this chapter and then Like in my time, yeah yeah
we're entering over time uh but yeah we'll finish this chapter and
then i will like off camera and then i'll come back with it kind of
like in a preliminary state and do like some edits and some like
different techniques that we can do and like show off different novel
crafter prompts um and yeah it'll be it'll be a bit of fun i think um
so yeah i hope you all enjoyed yourself um and uh enjoy your breakfast
lunch dinner uh whatever you end up eating um yeah bye.
